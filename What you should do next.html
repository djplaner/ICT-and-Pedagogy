<p>To ensure a good start to the course there are a few tasks you should aim to complete ASAP.  In the past, not completing these tasks correctly and on time has create enormous problems for some students. The ramifications of these problems have included failing the course and having to repeat it.</p>
<p>Please avoid this.</p>
<p>The following covers the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Prepare for your Professional Experience placement. </li>
  <li> Set up your learning environment. </li>
  <li> Set up the new digital tools you'll be using for EDC3100. </li>
</ol></div>

<p>You can <strong>not</strong> pass this course without passing Professional Experience (or being exempt from it, see below). </p>
<p>You are expected to go on Professional Experience between the <span class="dj_value">PE_START</span> and the <span class="dj_value">PE_STOP</span>. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have followed the placement process for going on Professional Experience.</p>

   <div class="dj_activity">
    <p>Visit <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/current-students/assessment/professional-experience/placement">the placement process page</a> on the Professional Experience website. Ensure that you have completed all of the tasks required.</p>

<h3>Are you exempt from Professional Experience?</h3>

<p>If you are repeating this course within 12 months of failing it and you have previously passed the Professional Experience component, then you may not need to go on Professional Experience this semester.</p>
<p>If you are in this situation, then:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Please contact <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/current-students/assessment/professional-experience/contact-us">the Professional Experience office</a> ASAP to confirm that you are exempt. </li>
  <li> If exempt, please inform the <a href="{{{CE_LINK}}}">the Course Examiner</a> - <span class="dj_value">CE_NAME. </span></li>
</ol>

        <section title="Set up your learning environment" data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="3" data-contentformat="1" data-hidden="0">
        <head><h1>Set up your learning environment</h1></head>
        <div><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/dj_macro.js"></script> 



<p>During this course you will be expected to make heavy use of Internet-based applications, your computer and other ICTs. Please make sure you have a digital environment that will allow you to do this. You will need to think about questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Do I have regular and appropriate access to computer hardware? <br>(i.e. can you kick the kids off for long enough?)</li>
  <li> Will your Internet connection be fast enough and have a bigger enough download limit? </li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need a suite of devices and lightning fast broadband to complete the course. But the better your digital environment the more open will be your options. If you have any concerns, please <a href="{{{CE_LINK}}}">contact the course examiner</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned, EDC3100 will draw on some additional and perhaps novel digital tools to enhance and transform your learning. To get the most out of the course, you will need to set up these tools. Doing this before semester starts is a good idea.</p>
<p>This task is officially part of the Week 1 learning path, however, completing it early is a good idea.</p>
<p>This is a task that may take a little while.</p>


<div class="dj_task"> 
  <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Set up your EDC3100 digital tools</p></div>  
  <div class="dj_activity">
    <p>Complete the set up of your digital tools for EDC3100 by working through <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=646">this book</a> from the Week 1 learning path.</p>

<p>This ends the material for the <span class="dj_value">W0_TITLE</span> learning path. By completing this learning path the hope is that you are prepared to engage effectively with the course once semester starts.</p>
