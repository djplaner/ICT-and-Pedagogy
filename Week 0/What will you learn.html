<p>The name of this course is <em>ICT and Pedagogy</em> and, not unsurprisingly, that is what you will be learning in this course.  In particular,</p><blockquote>How can you use digital technologies to enhance and transform the learning experiences you design?</blockquote>
<p>In doing this you will learn and practice some additional knowledge, but the main focus remains how to harness digital technologies to enhance and transform learning.</p>

<p>As always, the <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/course/synopses/2015/EDC3100.html">course specification</a> provides more detail about the course, its synopsis, and learning objectives.</p>

<h3>What you learn may differ</h3>

<p>There's no way I can know exactly what you will learn. You may learn some of what follows. You may also learn a lot more than what is described in the following. This is because, as Goodyear and Dimitriadis (2013) put it</p><blockquote>One cannot design someone else's experience. One cannot design their happiness. One cannot design their learning. Only the person who is learning can learn. Someone involved in the design for learning can design <em>thinks</em> the help other people learn. (p. 2)</blockquote> 
<p>We've designed this course to help you learn what is described on the following pages.  Whether this is what you will learn depends on you, and how well our design helps you.</p>

<p>Kirschner and Wopereis (2003) suggest three factors why (in the course we'll call these the &quot;big three&quot;, even though they aren't that big)- even over 10 years ago - that &quot;an increasing number of countries include ICT in the curricula of initial teacher training&quot; (p. 105). These are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> ICT can help prepare the next generation for the future workplace;
       <p>The assumption is that to be a productive member of society from now and into the future, they will have to be effective users of digital technologies (ICT).</p>
        <p>Are you prepared for a teaching workplace that relies heavily on digital technologies?</p>
  </li>
  <li> ICT can make schools more efficient and productive; and, 
       <p>Digital technologies are meant to make any number of tasks more efficient and productive. Learning and teaching is no different.</p>
      <p>Are you currently using digital technologies to make your learning more efficient and productive?</p>
  </li>
  <li> ICT can reform and innovate learning and teaching.
      <p>More importantly, digital technologies can enhance and transform learning and teaching. Enable you to design learning experiences that were previously impossible.</p>
      <p>How can you enhance and transform your learning and teaching?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these reasons are part of why you are studying this course. They also cover aspects of what you will learn in this course.</p>
<p>These are perhaps the three big or main reasons for this course.</p>

<h3>Pedagogy = learning and teaching</h3>

<p>While we cover all three of those reasons, the course is called <em>ICT and Pedagogy</em>. Our particular focus is on the last reason. Using ICT to reform and innovate learning and teaching. This is the reason we'd like you to explore in much more detail.</p>

<div class="dj_task"> 
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Start gathering your reasons why</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>Whenever you use ICT in your pedagogy, it should be used purposefully. i.e. there should be clear and good reasons for using ICT. The <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=785&amp;chapterid=2930">first assignment</a> for this course is - at its core - designed to encourage you to start exploring and evaluating reasons why you might use ICT in your students learning. Throughout the learning paths for this course and in your own study you will come across a whole range of different reasons for using ICT and pedagogy.</p>
     <p>It's a really, really good idea for you to start a collection of reasons why you might use ICT in your pedagogy. As you are working on this course, or in other courses, whenever you think of or see a reason (good or bad) for using ICT, add it to that list.</p>

<p>If you want a more visual reason for why you are learning about ICT and Pedagogy. Then perhaps the photo to the right (click on it, to see a larger version) helps. As you may already know from your own lived experience, digital technologies are increasingly pervasive. The youngest members of our society are increasingly using these technologies (though not everyone is). The technologies are becoming a standard part of their life and it would be strange if those technologies were not part of their learning experiences.</p>

<h3>Even government knows this</h3>

<p>Even as far back as 2008 the truly &quot;digitally native&quot; collection of folk that are the Australian Education Ministers were aware of the importance of ICT in learning. Their <a href="https://education.gov.au/melbourne-declaration-educational-goals-young-people">Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young People</a> (MCEETYA, 2008) included such statements as</p><blockquote>Successful learners...have the essential skills in literacy and numeracy and are creative and productive users of technology, especially ICT, as a foundation for success in all learning areas (p. 8)</blockquote>
<p>and</p><blockquote>Rapid and continuing advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) are changing the ways people share, use, develop and process information and technology.  In this digital age, young people need to be highly skilled in the use of ICT.  While schools already employ these technologies in learning, there is a need to increase their effectiveness significantly over the next decade.</blockquote>

   <div class="dj_activity">
    <p>Are you a &quot;creative and productive user of technology&quot; in your learning?</p>

<p>The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST) aim to &quot;make explicit the elements of high quality teaching&quot; and include the following standards for graduate teachers.</p>
<p></p><blockquote><strong>2.6 Information and Communication Technology</strong>
<p>Implement teaching strategies for using ICT to expand curriculum learning opportunities for students.</p> </blockquote>
<p></p><blockquote><strong>3.4 Select and use resources</strong>
<p>Demonstrate knowledge of a range of resources, including ICT, that engage students in their learning. </p></blockquote>
<p></p><blockquote><strong>4.5 Use ICT safely, responsibly and ethically</strong>
<p>Demonstrate an understanding of the relevant issues and the strategies available to support the safe, responsible and ethical use of ICT in learning and teaching. </p></blockquote>

<p>As you work through this course, you will also have the opportunity to work toward a number of the other APSTs to varying extents. Including the following.</p>
<p></p><blockquote><strong>7.4 Engage with professional teaching networks and broader communities</strong><p>Understand the role of external professionals and community representatives in broadening teachers’ professional knowledge and practice.</p></blockquote>
<p></p><blockquote><strong>7.3 Engage with the parents/carers</strong>
<p>Understand strategies for working effectively, sensitively and confidentially with parents/carers. </p></blockquote>
<p></p><blockquote><strong>3.2 Plan, structure and sequence learning programs</strong><p>Plan lesson sequences using knowledge of student learning, content and effective teaching strategies. </p></blockquote>

<h3>Demonstrating your capabilities</h3>
<p>In completing this course you should enhance your ability to demonstrate your capabilities against these - and some of the other - APSTs.</p>

<div class="dj_task"> 
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Create and gather evidence</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>Many of you are within a year or two of graduation and looking for work. It's past time for you to start preparing for this.</p>
      <p>For those of you in the school sector, this means gathering evidence against the APSTs to include in the portfolio you will use as part of your job applications. This course provides a number of opportunities for you to create and gather evidence against the APSTs.</p>
       <p>It's recommended that you create and start using a process by which you gather and store this evidence. In particular, you should have a process that tells you which APSTs you may not have sufficient evidence against. So you can pro-actively plan to fill those gaps.</p>

<p>The major aim of this course is for you to learn more about how you can use digital technologies to enhance and transform your learning and teaching. In doing this, you will also learn how to become more efficient at teaching and you will also prepare your students for productive participation in a world that relies increasingly on digital technologies.</p>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>So far, we've looked at who you are, and what you will learn in this course. The next step is to examine <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=640">how you will learn</a> in this course (well, actually just how the course has been designed, whether you learn this way is up to you).</p>
