<h1>Design an online learning event</h1>
<p>Your group of four students will</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a topic/question/issue around the use of ICTs in learning and teaching that you are interested in and need to learn more about.</li>
<li>Design an effective online learning event that allows others to learn more about your chosen topic/question/issue.</li>
<li>Publicise and run the event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The question</h2>
<p>What are your burning questions around the use of ICTs for teaching and learning? What do you need to know before you go on Professional Experience?</p>
<p>As a group, you need to find an answer to these questions. You need to identify the particular question, topic or problem that your group would like to learn more about. The question should be focused on pedagogical, curriculum, or related issues around the use of ICT in learning and teaching. Some examples include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The potential of web 2.0 directions to challenge the interpretation of multimodal texts in the national curriculum.</li>
<li>Using simulations to promote inquisitiveness in science/history/curriculum area.</li>
<li>Developing conceptual understandings in Mathematics/Science/History using ICT tools.</li>
<li>Using Socratic Questions to stimulate deep conversations in an online community or with an online guest.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah9aZ7LiPYTxdDVnLTRYclI1d0lpVmZTNlhBdVNvMWc">this Google spreadsheet</a> has a list of many of the learning events from the Semester 1 2012 offering of this course, including the URLs for the websites.</p>
<p>Some general advice about your question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend a lot of time making sure it is an engaging, interesting and relevant question to you or the audience you design your event for.</li>
<li>Don't make the question too broad.</li>
<li>Focus on something that will help you prepare for using ICTs to teach on your professional experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The pedagogical model</h2>
<p>You need to design an online learning event that will last no more than 1-2 hours for your participants. Your design must be underpinned by a sound, pedagogical model. You might wish to describe and design your online event using a metaphor. For example, a debate, a learning circle, a mini-conference, a discovery learning lesson, a tutorial, a training camp, a resources review, an interview with an expert, a panel discussion , Live Q and A etc. Be creative.</p>
<p>The event does not have be over within 1-2 hours, but the period of time a participant spends on your event should only be 1-2 hours. Those 1-2 hours might be spread out over a longer period of time (e.g. a few days, a week) where participants are expected to engage in asynchronous activities such as reading, watching or posting to a forum.</p>
<p>You may use whatever combination of online technologies you deem appropriate for your pedagogical model and question.</p>
<p>Some general advice about the pedagogical model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be creative. <br />For the learning you design in assignment 2 you will be constrained by the school environment. You aren't constrained for this assignment. Use whatever approach or technology you can think of. For example, one of the groups from last semester carried out their event on Twitter.</li>
<li>Use outside experts. <br />You don't have to produce the content for this event. You could choose an event where you interview an outside expert, or run a panel sessions like <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/">Q&amp;A</a>. For example, one of the groups from last semester asked children's book author Mem Fox to be on their event.</li>
<li>Design an event for a broader audience.<br /> By default, other EDC3100 students will enrol in your event. But don't limit yourself to them. Feel free to invite people from outside the course to participate in your event.</li>
<li>Don't kill yourself.<br />This assignment is worth 29% of your final mark. The design of your online event is worth a subset of that. Don't spend weeks designing and implementing your event.</li>
<li>Explore different technologies.<br />For many of you, you will not be familiar with all of the available technologies. There are some really interesting technologies currently available. Be sure you have a good look around.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>
<p>As part of your design you will need to plan and identify the roles and responsibilities for all participants. Both for the members of your team, any invited guests, and for any other participants. For example, members of your team may take on roles such as event facilitator, moderator, researchers, routine summariser, technical helper etc. You will need to ensure that these roles and responsibilities align with the pedagogical model you have chosen and are designed to ensure that your event works effectively.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>You should also include specific descriptions of the learning activities and interventions you group will undertake to initiate, manage, and bring to a close your successful learning event.</p>
<p>Remember, the aim here it to encourage and deepen learning. Your activities should align with your pedagogical model and should move participants beyond passive activities such as watching videos toward activities that are constructive and authentic.</p>
<h2>The online presence</h2>
<p>Your online event will need to have a web presences that is used to tell people about the event. The presence should include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction to the event.
<ul>
<li>A description of the problem/question/issue.</li>
<li>Details of the team who designed the event and the role they are playing.</li>
<li>What will the participants be expected to do.</li>
<li>The type of event: what will it feel like, be like, look like? What will be the general sequence of events?</li>
<li>Rules or guide to etiquette for the event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some relevant content or information.<br />At least a short page or two to give background on the event, prepare participants.</li>
<li>A link to the conversation tool which records the conversations.<br /> This could be a synchronous tool like Wimba, a Twitter archive, or a asyncrhonous forums like a discussion forum, a blog, a wiki etc.</li>
<li>A concluding statement or finding.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose any tool or system for your online presence. A blog, a Wiki, a Weebly site, Facebook page. You should aim at being short and concise in the information you provide and te pages you develop. Provide only a few selected resources that are sufficient for your audience to meaningfully digest sufficient content and for you to the meet the standards on the criteria for the assignment. Your online presence should be a one-stop shop for your participants and the marker.</p>
<p>Ensure that the story you tell provides you with an opportunity to meet the criteria for the assignment.</p>
<p>Some better examples of an online presences from last semester include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://authenticictintegration.weebly.com/">Moving towards authentic integration of ICTs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://edc3100a1.weebly.com/">The effectiveness of Twitter as an educational tool in the primary classroom</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also see other examples listed in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah9aZ7LiPYTxdDVnLTRYclI1d0lpVmZTNlhBdVNvMWc#gid=0">this Google spreadsheet</a>. Remember, not all of these examples are necessary good examples.</p>

<p><a name="participate"></a></p>
<h1>Participate in three OLEs</h1>
<p>During week 5 of the semester, you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Participate in your team's event and the events of two other teams.</li>
<li>Create an activity log that records your participation in all three events.<br /> The activity log will include: dates, thread title/equivalent, and a brief statement of what you contributed <strong>and why</strong>. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wD4x4qZpEBHI_CwFstfHOiNmQ--fppV6va23fpL6hyA/edit#heading=h.re8798g3h94n">this example</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> before participating, make sure you read the <a href="#reflection">"Reflect" section</a> below.</p>
<p>In your team's events you are expected to deepen conversations, be supportive and responsive to other learners, and fulfill any roles assigned to you by the team.</p>
<p>For the events organised by other teams you will summarise your contributions in an activity log. This will include: dates, thread title/equivalent, and a brief statement of what you contributed. Provide a URL for both events and clearly indicate which activities were associated with which groups.</p>
<p>Some general advice about participation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose events to participate in that will help you for assignment 2 or other work.</li>
<li>Choose events that have times that are spread throughout week 5.</li>
<li><strong>As you are participating, think about your learning and the learning of others. What's the quality of the current learning? What do you know about improving learning? Think about what you might do to improve that learning? </strong></li>
<li><strong>As you are participating, think about why you are going to perform a certain task or ask that question, related to what you know about learning.</strong></li>
<li>As you are participating, make sure you record your participation. <br />Some events might do this for you (e.g. a post on a discussion forum, or a recording of an audio conference), or you may need to make your own recording.</li>
<li>Think about how you can make a quality contribution to all events, the quality matters.</li>
<li>As you are designing your online learning event, start listing the strategies and techniques you are thinking of using for your event and <strong>why you are using them</strong>.</li>

<p><a name="reflection"></a></p>
<h1>Reflect</h1>
<p>Having designed and participated in online learning events, your next task is to reflect on what you experienced in those events. You will</p>
<ol>
<li><del>Create a concept map that summarises all of the strategies and techniques you observed during your participation in all three events.</del></li>
<li>Complete a Plus-Minus-Interesting (PMI) table about the online event that you helped design.</li>
<li>Identify the top two qualities or effective techniques used in your event and explain why you think they were so effective.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some general advice about reflection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you complete the activities during Weeks 2 and 3 that will give you some insight and practice at this type of reflection.</li>
<li>Ask "Dr Google" to find out more about what makes a good <del>concept map and</del> PMI and discover tools you can use to create them.</li>
<li>As you are designing your online learning event, start listing the strategies and techniques you are thinking of using for your event and <strong>why you are using them</strong>. <del>Use this concept map to evaluate the design.</del></li>
<li><strong>As you are completing your PMI, don't limit yourself to being descriptive (i.e. just describing what you found as a plus, minus or an interesting). Try to be evaluative as well (i.e. why do you think something was a plus, minus or an interesting). </strong></li>

<p><a name="suggestion"></a></p>
<h1>Curriculum suggestion</h1>
<p>With the above you have gained some experience of designing online learning events. Now it's time to think about how you might use this in your own teaching. You are going to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a small but significant area from the Australian Curriculum (or the curriculum to your teaching).</li>
<li>Design an online learning event that would engage studets in learning that curriculum area.</li>
<li>Describe your idea.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will submit a brief outline of a curriculum suggestion that describes your plan. The outline should use the following headings:</p>
<ol>
<li>The context - about the class, its age level, access to computers in the classroom etc.</li>
<li>The key idea in a short paragraph or a couple of sentences.</li>
<li>Describe the curriculum goals. Lists are fine.</li>
<li>Describe the event.</li>
<li>List or describe the technology tools used online.</li>
<li>Briefly outline the core activity sequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some general advice about the curriculum suggestion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=18854">this discussion in the assignment forum</a>.</li>

<h1>Design and implement an ICT-rich Unit of Work (UoW)</h1>
<p>You will design a sequence of at least 5 lessons - a unit of work - that are rich in their use of ICTs. You will implement these lessons while on your professional experience.</p>
<p>As part of your unit of work, you will need to provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>An explanation of the overall idea and a rationale for your approach/interpretation;</li>
<li>the national (or other appropriate) curriculum proficiency strands and content descriptions or similar learning statements from another curriculum framework;</li>
<li>a clear explanation of the pedagogical approach with reasons for this choice;</li>
<li>a plan of the sequence of lessons/activities with a brief description of each and a summary of your reflections on the lessons;</li>
<li>the lesson plans;
<p>You must use the <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/92090/mod_folder/content/2/USQ_Generic_Lesson_Planning_TemplatePortrait.doc?forcedownload=1">USQ lesson planning template</a> for this.</p>
</li>
<li>any resources you develop for the unit;</li>
<li>an annotated list of other resources used in the unit;</li>
<li>an assessment piece and criteria sheet including the standards for making judgements about the student work;
<p>Refer to the achievement standards of your curriculum documents for guidance.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Justification:</strong> a statement describing how this unit of work, especially your curriculum interpretation and choices of pedagogy and classroom strategies, benefits learners, <strong>and how it might be improved</strong>; and,</li>
<li>a brief description of a scenario where a student in your class has special needs of some type and what you would do (or did do) to account for his/her needs while implementing this work.</li>
</ol>
<p>You must provide evidence of implementation which needs to include samples of student work and a letter of recognition from your supervising teacher. If it is difficult to implement your lessons in normal class settings, be creative about implementing the idea. For example, work with a group in a computer club type arrangement after school or in breaks.</p>
<h3>General advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's not about teaching your students how to use ICTs.<br />The aim of the assignments and this course is for you to demonstrate how you can use ICTs to improve student learning. The aim of this course and this assignment is not for you to show how you can teach your students to use a computer.
<p>An side effect of your teaching may be that your students know more about using computers, but it's not to be the primary focus. The primary focus is on using ICTs to achieve a curricula outcome (e.g. writing an informative text).</p>
<p>(Aside: if you are teaching Year 12 IPT, then you may be a slight exception to this rule. You will still be teaching students how to achieve computer-relate curriculum content. But we're assessing how well you use ICTs to improve student learning).</p>
</li>
<li>On the sequence of 5 lessons.<br />It is strongly preferred that the 5 lessons form a sequence or a unit of work. To allow you a chance to develop a theme or idea to really use ICTs to their best effect. However, this may not be possible on your professional experience. So, it is acceptable to include lessons from a range of subjects. If you can't do 5 lessons, can you do 4? If not 4, 3? <br /> </li>
<li>Talk with your mentor teacher. <br />What you will teach in your 5 lessons depends on your mentor teacher and what your class is currently learning about. As early as possible, talk with your mentor teacher about this assignment and what you need to do. Find out about what ICTs are available, what constraints exist, what experience the students have and identify what you will be teaching and any other factors.<br /> </li>
<li>Aim to teach the lessons towards the end of professional experience. <br /> Getting to know your class and the students is essential. Give yourself the first two weeks to get to know your class better so it can inform your planning. <br /> </li>
<li>You don't need to implement the assessment item.<br />Your mentor teacher almost certainly has the assessment for her/his class already planned. You almost certainly won't get a chance to implement your assessmen tpiece and criteria sheet with your class. That's ok. <br /> </li>
<li>How many ICTs do I need to use for it to be ICT rich?<br />Wrong question. We don't care about how many different ICTs you used in your teaching. We care about how you use what ICTs you do have to create effective, apprropriate and innovative learning experiences for your students. We're interested in you figuring out how to use ICTs in ways that are essential to student learning, deepen student learning, and open them up to learning experiences that weren't previously available.
<p>Using an Interactive White Board to show a video and some slides, is not a great use of ICTs.</p>
</li>
<li>Focus on getting a good idea. <br />If you don't have a good driving question or topic for the five lessons, you will find it very hard to use ICTs creatively and innovatively. Spend a lot of time on developing an idea for your Unit of Work that will engage the students.<br /> </li>
<li>Get feedback, share and collaborate. <br />Share your idea with friends and fellow students. Get feedback. Look at what others have done. Consider how you can use those ideas.<br /> </li>
<li>Make sure you reflect directly after teaching. <br />You are expected to reflect on your 5 lessons and include that reflection in your eportfolio in both your lesson plans and your summary of the lessons. Your reflections will be most effective when you start them soon after actually teaching each lesson. Feel free to include insights from your mentor and think about what you might do differently next time.</li>

You are to develop a curriculum suggestion (you do not need to implement the suggestion) for your professional experience site that will devleop the digitial citizenship of a group of students.</p>
<p>You will prepare an outline of your curriculum suggestion using essentially the same structure as the <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=799&amp;chapterid=2963#suggestion">curriculum suggestion for Assignment 1</a>. It should include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The context - describe the student cohort and the site details that your suggestion is intended for. <br />This could be your class, all the year 1s or some other grouping of students. Your choice.<br /> </li>
<li>Describe the curriculum goals for the suggestion. <br />The goals should be to develop student knowledge of digitial citizenship. You choose exactly what. Your choice should be appropriate to the context and the students. It should connect with the appropriate broader curriculum requirements for your context (e.g. <a href="http://education.qld.gov.au/smartclassrooms/enabling-learners/ict-expectations/index.html">Education Queensland's Student ICT Expectations</a> or the <a href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/GeneralCapabilities/Information-and-Communication-Technology-capability/Introduction/Background">Australian National Curriculum's ICT capabilities</a>).
<p>Include an explanation of why this particular curriculum goal is important/relevant to the development of digital citizenship skills for your students.</p>
</li>
<li>The key idea in a short paragraph or a couple of sentences. <br />Why are the students going to be interested in this suggestion? Why will they see it as authentic? <br /> </li>
<li>Give an overview of how it will work.</li>
<li>Provide an annotated list of the resources and ICTs to be used. <br />A summary of what is needed to implement this curriculum suggestion and why you've chosen particular resources and how they will be used.<br /> </li>
<li>Briefly outline the core activity sequence.</li>
</ol>
<h3>General advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Show your understandings of digital citizenship. <br />One of the reasons for this activity is for you to show your understanding of digital citizenship. Ensure that your curriculum suggestion demonstrates this understanding and your ability to apply it to your specific context. <br /> </li>
<li>There should be a connection/rationale running throughout the components of your curriculum suggestion. <br />e.g. the use of ICTs should help the students achieve the stated curriculum objectives through a key idea that excites and engages them. The sequence of events should help the students deepen their learning.<br /> </li>
<li>Aim for something innovative.<br />You don't need to implement this. So plan for something a little different, both in terms of how you normally teach. <strong>Repeat</strong> This suggestion isn't something you need to teach. Be creative. It doesn't need to be connected to other aspects.</li>

<h1>ICT Indicators Statement</h1>
<p>The ICT Certificate from Education Queensland acknowledges teachers who understand how learners can use ICT purposefully. Teachers seeking ICT Certificate accreditation need to demonstrate that their practice aligns with <a href="http://education.qld.gov.au/smartclassrooms/developing-professionals/elearning-frameworks/pd-framework/ict-certificate/indicators.html">these indicators</a>. You will compile evidence for the requirements of the certificate through the activities of this course and present that evidence in your eportfolio.</p>
<h3>General advice for the indicators</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete the ramble activities associated with the ICT indicators.</li>
<li>Write for a professional audience.
<p>The evidence you provide against the indicators should not be written for the teaching staff of this course. It should be written as if a professional assessor was reading it.</p>
</li>
<li>Pay close attention to the quality and presentation of your evidence.</li>
<li>Keep it concise and to the point <br />A paragraph or two per response is a reasonable target. But it needs to be focused on showing your evidence.</li>
<li>Provide a link to specific evidence.
<p>i.e. don't just say "I attended a training session on using an IWB". Make sure you provide a link to the certificate you received for attending. Or if you use participating in an online event in a response to an indicator, link to the event and link to your activity log from assignment 1 that outlines your participation.</p>
</li>
<li>Address the indicator.
<p>Make sure that your evidence actually does match the indicator. Try to use the words from within the indicator as part of your response. For example, the Professional Value indicators mentions "improve my digital literacy and pedagogy". Make sure you response actually achieves this and use the words "digital literacy and pedagogy" in your response.</p>
</li>
<li>Explain how it addresses the indicator.
<p>Make it explicit how your evidence helps you address the indicator.</p>
</li>
<li>Use the same piece of evidence numerous times.
<p>For example, the lessons you developed for assignment 2 are likely to provide evidence to support a number of the indicators.</p>
</li>

</div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="9" data-contentformat="1" data-title="Professional Experience" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">Professional Experience</h1><p>To pass this course, you must successfully complete 15 days of Professional experience. The following provides a range of information (and pointers to more information) about your Professional experience.</p>
<p><strong>The focus for professional experience for EDC3100 is the use of ICTs for learning and teaching.</strong> This is strongly linked to <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/mod/book/view.php?id=524749&amp;chapterid=6442">Assignment 2</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure you read <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=799&amp;chapterid=2962#early">why you can't start professional experience early (generally)</a>.</p>
<h2>What you need to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you know the dates for professional experience. <br /> Check out the <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/education/professional-experience/placement">2012 Professional experience calendar</a> on the Placement process page.</li>
<li>If you are based in Queensland, make sure your blue card is current for that time (<a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/education/professional-experience/blue-card">or renew it</a>) and registered with USQ.</li>
<li>If you are outside Queensland, you must ensure that you meet all legal requirements and criminal history checks as required.</li>
<li>Download (and print) your own copy of <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/education/professional-experience/forms">The Professional Experience booklet</a> for <strong>your specialisation</strong>.</li>
<li>Be prepared to organise your placement (see below).</li>
</ul>
<h2>General information</h2>
<p>A detailed <a href="@@PLUGINFILE@@/ProfExp2012sem2PE.ppt">set of Powerpoint slides are available</a> and provide a detailed summary of professional experience in general.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/education/professional-experience">Professional Experience website</a>. <br />This is where you find all the forms, booklets, calendars, SONIA and information about professional experience. Including how to contact the professional experience team.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a current Blue Card. <br />If you do not have a Blue Card, you will not be able to do professional experience in Queensland.</li>
<li>The calendar.<br />Dates for all professional experience are set in the <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/education/professional-experience/placement">Calendar</a> but take into consideration additional make up days that might be required for show/public holidays, illness or exams.</li>
<li>Confirmation of placements. <br /><a href="https://sonia3.usq.edu.au/Sonia/">SONIA</a> confirms all placements at least 10 days before the placement commences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why you can't start Professional Experience early</h3>

<p>For EDC3100, ICTs and Pedagogy you must complete 15 days of Professional Experience.  As per the Professional Experience calendar and the course study schedule, your Professional Experience is scheduled to start on the 8th of October.<p>
<p>
You will almost certainly NOT be allowed to start your Professional Experience early.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is that Assignment 2 - 70% of your assessment in this course - requires you to develop a sequence of at least 5 lessons rich in ICT use. You have to deliver these lessons while on your Professional Experience.</p>
<p>
If you do your Professional Experience earlier, you must complete a great deal of work in a very short period of time to have any chance of passing.</p>
<p>
People who try to do Professional Experience early will almost certainly find it very difficult to get a good (even passing) mark for the second assignment.</p>
<p>
There is always some space to negotiate, please let us know if you have problems, but my strong advice is that you try your utmost not to do Professional Experience early. And please don't be disappointed if you are told now.</p></div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="10" data-contentformat="1" data-title="Discussion forums" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">Discussion forums</h1><p>There are a number of different forums for this course.
