<h2>Assessment and the Australian Curriculum (and other curricula)</h2>

<p>The following list offers general advice about how each of the assignments may be associated with the Australian Curriculum.</p>
<h3>Assignment 1</h3>

       <p>No requirement that the Australian Curriculum must be used, but it can help.</p>
<p> For part 1 (the learning journal) you simply need to complete the study desk activities and your learning journal posts. We won't be checking here if you're using the Australian Curriculum or not. But where appropriate you should use it.</p>
<p>For part 2, it is important that the reasons, evidence and examples you provide are appropriate to the context you describe. The Australian Curriculum (or other appropriate curriculum documents) may provide evidence and examples, but you are not required to use them.</p>

<h3>Assignment 2 (and Module 2)</h3>

      <p>Module 2 and Assignment 2 develop and assess your ability to design a unit of work aligned with a curriculum. The module and assignment will be using the Australian Curriculum as the main context. </p>
      <p>If you have a teaching area that is connected with the Australian Curriculum, you must use it for this module and assignment.</p>
      <p>If your teaching areas don't include the Australian Curriculum (e.g. TAFE/VET sector or overseas students) then you will need to use your appropriate curriculum documents (please contact the course examiner if you are in this situation). </p>


<h3>Assignment 3</h3>

      <p>Focuses on you preparing, teaching and reflecting/evaluating on your Professional Experience. This will include appropriate use of the curriculum documents appropriate to the context.  i.e. you use whatever is in use at your Professional Experience site.</p>
</div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="2" data-contentformat="1" data-title="Learning Journal" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">Learning Journal</h1><h2>What is a learning journal?</h2>

<p>For EDC3100, your learning journal is a record of your thoughts, impressions, concerns, questions and reflections as you proceed through the course. A learning journal is meant to capture your experiences, feelings and reflections. For EDC3100 it will also be where you share some of the artifacts you create during the course. It is your space.</p>
<p>The constraints on your learning journal are</p>
<ol>
  <li> It must be implemented using the blog you create in Week 1. </li>
  <li>	It should be used to record and reflect upon the learning you undertake as part of your EDC3100 journey. (some advice on this below)</li>
  <li>	You should be posting to it regularly throughout the term. </li>
</ol>

<h2>How will it be marked?</h2>

<p>Your learning journal in combination with your completion of the Study Desk activities, will contribute a total of 15% of your final mark for this course. 5% in each assignment. </p>
<p>Your learning journal will not be analysed by the teaching staff and marked against a rubric. This is so you feel free to reflect as you wish in your journal and are not tempted to write what you think we want to hear.</p>
<p>That said, your blog will by default be open to others. You are encouraged to comment on the work of others and have them comment on your work. This is a part of constructing your PLN.  </p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the public nature of your blog, please contact the course examiner.</p>
<p>To get the complete 15% for the learning journal (and activities) component of the assessment, you will need to</p>
<ol>
  <li> Post regularly to your learning journal.
   <p>2+ posts per week is a minimum standard, more is better.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Ensure the posts are meaningful, reflective and are of a good standard.
<p>You don’t have to use formal academic writing, however, you should appreciate that your blog and your journal are a professional document. It should reflect your status as a professional educator. It should demonstrate appropriate ethical (e.g. don’t copy the work of others), spelling and grammatical standards.</p> </li>
  <li>	Complete all of the activities on the Study Desk.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your final mark will be determined by a combination of</p>
<ol>
  <li> Automated assessment and analysis.<p>
A computer program will be used to ensure that you completed all Study Desk activities, that you have posted regularly during the semester, and that the posts are of a reasonable quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Random sampling.
      <p>Teaching staff will manually check a random sample of learning journals.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>The main reasons for asking you to keep a learning journal include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> To encourage you to reflect on your learning.<p>You can't learn effectively without engaging in reflection. </p>
  </li>
  <li> To make your learning visible and thus encourage discussion and collaboration.</li>
  <li> To provide a reason to engage in writing a blog and building your PLN.</li>
  <li> Provide you with artifacts you can use for other assignments.<p>
Some of what you post on your blog will be re-used for other assignments. </p>
  </li>
  <li> To encourage you to engage in the active use of ICTs for your own learning.<p>
All of these contribute to the overall reason for asking you to maintain a learning journal. i.e. to improve your learning.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What do I need to do?</h2>

<p>In short, you need to engage in a cycle of Personal Knowledge Management as explained during the <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/page/view.php?id=888">Week 1 activities</a>. As a part of this you should also be (don’t limit yourself to just these)</p>
<ol>
  <li> Adding posts in response to tasks on the Study Task. </li>
  <li>	Engaging in reflection about your learning.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>Every time you engage with an EDC3100 learning task, give some thought to what has happened and how you are feeling about it. If there’s something you need to reflect more deeply upon, develop your thinking while writing, or share with others then write a blog post about it.</p>
<p>You don’t need to write a journal entry for everything you do for the course, but when something strikes you as important, puzzling, difficult, misleading, strange, fun, exciting, amazing or simply interesting then you should explore and write about that feeling. Why? How does it connect to what you know? How does it transform what you believe?</p>
<p>At times the course material will post questions about what you’ve just done or read. These are intended to encourage you to reflect and consider your perspective. These would be good opportunities to write a post (or at least part of one).</p>
<p>It is expected that you should have at least two blog posts per week.</p>
<p>Some questions that might help you get started with reflection, include (but certainly aren't limited to):</p>
<ol>
  <li> What do you think (and feel) about the concepts and ideas you’ve engaged with? Why?</li>
  <li> Did anything inspire you? </li>
  <li> What puzzled you? What seemed difficult or contradictory?</li>
  <li> What do you need to know more about and how can you get that knowledge?</li>
  <li> Have any of your opinions or values changed? </li>
  <li>	What can you do better next time? To learn better? </li>
  <li> How can I use what I've learned in my  teaching? </li>
  <li> What do I need to know to use that in my teaching? </li>
</ol>

<p><A href="http://www.peterpappas.com/2010/01/taxonomy-reflection-critical-thinking-students-teachers-principals-.html">This post</a> provides a taxonomy of reflection tied to Bloom's taxonomy that could prove useful.</p>

</ul>

<h2>ICTs: Why and what?</h2>

<p>Later in the semester you will be going on Professional Experience. On Professional Experience - as stated in the Professional Experience handbook – your required tasks will include:<blockquote>Teaching and planning: Lesson sequences and small units of work where ICT is integral to the learning and teaching process</blockquote></p>
<p>In doing this, you are likely to encounter teachers at your site who are less than convinced about the value of integrating ICTs. In the past this has sometimes included a student’s mentor. Even though sites are advised that the purpose of the EDC3100 Professional Experience is ICT integration.</p>
<p>Your task is to convince them why integrating ICTs into your students’ learning is a good idea.  To do this you will produce a “web-based artefact” that contains a persuasive argument for using ICTs in your Professional Experience context. </p>
<p>The term “web-based artefact” is used so as not to constrain your creativity. The only requirements are that it the artefact must be able to be viewed via a Web browser and must be presented or linked to from your blog.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>This assignment is intended to encourage you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Synthesise and personalise the reasons for integrating ICTs into your teaching and low a foundation for your work later in the semester.</li>
  <li> Encourage you to explore the use of an online medium for presenting information.</li>
</ul>
<p>More formally, the assignment is intended to provide you an opportunity to meet the following course objectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li> outline the influence on curriculum and pedagogy of historical and current international and national policies and initiatives relevant to the use of ICT in diverse learning and teaching contexts;</li>
  <li> examine, discuss and reflect on core ideas about the knowledge generation and knowledge economy and the implications of these for curriculum and pedagogy;</li>
  <li> discuss and reflect upon the role of ICT in the curriculum, learning and teaching;</li>
  <li> examine and critique personal beliefs and practices that impact on their use of ICT for learning and teaching;</li>
  <li> demonstrate competence in and appropriate use of language and literacy, including spelling, grammar, punctuation and bibliographic referencing. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>Your online artefact should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clearly describe your teaching context.
<p>If you don’t know exactly where your Professional Experience will be take an educated guess or pick a previous site where you have completed Professional Experience. Whatever you choose, it should be as close to type of site you will attend for your EDC3100 Professional Experience. Your description of the context should provide sufficient information to support your reasons for using ICTs. It might include: the relevant curriculum, available resources, the nature of the students, the site’s pedagogical framework or approach, or any other relevant information.</p>
  <p>The context does not necessarily need to be a class setting. It might be a sub-set of the class. For example, a particular group of learners within that class, or a particular subject area (or two).</p>
  </li>
  <li> Provide reasons for integrating ICTs into students’ learning within that context.
<p>The reasons should not be generic (e.g. “students with ICT-skills are more employable”). The reasons should be explained directly to your description of the teaching context (e.g. “our students have difficulty appreciating some abstract mathematical principles due to the limited physical conceptions). The reasons should be supported or draw upon established research, policy or other appropriate external foundations. </p>
  </li>
  <li> Use contextually appropriate example(s) to illustrate those reasons.
<p>Each reason should also be illustrated with an example of how another educator has already used ICTs to achieve the stated benefit. The example(s) should be drawn from a context very similar to your teaching context. That is, if you’re teaching into Year 3, then the example should be for a Year 3 class, or very close (e.g. year 2 or 4). </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The artefact should be no more than the equivalent of 1000 words or 7 minutes speaking time. It should be designed to generate a positive reaction from a viewer/reader.</p>

<h3>Example artefacts</h3>

<p>The week 2 learning path <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/course/view.php?id=14&section=3#A1examples">provides some examples</a> of what you web-based artefact might look like.</p>

<h2>Assignment 3 - Overview</h2>

<p>Assignment 3 is designed to help you prepare, implement and reflect on your use of ICTs in learning and teaching in a real context. It is designed to build on work you've already done in Assignments 1 and 2. The assignment is directly related to your Professional Experience and in particular the following from the Professional Experience Book (p. 19), in that it (emphasis added)<blockquote>provides preservice educators with the opportunity to demonstrate understanding related to ICT and pedagogy and their ability to integrate the curriculum, teaching and learning with ICT. This Professional Experience component will provide specific opportunities for preservice educators to <strong>plan</strong>, <strong>implement</strong> and <strong>reflect</strong> upon their developing ICT pedagogy.</blockquote></p>
<p>NOTE: The aim of this assignment (and course) is for you to design learning experiences that use ICTs to enhance student learning. It is <strong>not</strong> about teaching students to use ICTs.</p>
<p>The following table provides an overview of the components of this assignment.</p>

<h2>What to submit</h2>

<p>You will submit this assignment via EASE. You will submit a number of separate files including:</p>
<ol><li> A cover sheet with your details.  <p>
<a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/171366/mod_folder/content/0/EDC3100_A3_CoverSheet.docx?forcedownload=1">Download this coversheet</a> and fill in your details.</p>
</li><li>	A document containing your "Preparation and planning" essay.
</li><li>A document containing all five of your lesson plans.
<p>By default, you should use the EDC3100 lesson plan template. If your context requires you to use another lesson plan template, that's okay. See the lesson plan section below for more information.</p>
</li><li>	A document containing your "Evaluation and Lessons Learned" essay.
</ol>

<p>There is no need for you to provide the URL for your blog for the Learning Journal.</p>

<h2>Part A: Learning Journal</h2>
<a name="parta"></a>

<p>The learning journal component is similar to the learning journal from assignments 1 and 2. It consists of two parts:</p>
<ol> <li> Completion of the learning path activities for weeks 9, 10, 11 and 15 of semester.
 </li> <li> During weeks 9, 10, 11 and 15 write posts on your blog each week that reflect on that week’s EDC3100 learning path. </li>
</ol>
<p>You do not need to complete either the learning path activities your blog while you are Professional Experience.</p>

<h3>Rubric - Part A</h3>

<p>This component will mostly be marked automatically using various ICTs. Random checks of a sample of student learning journals will supplement the automated marking.</p>

<h2>Part B - Preparation and Planning</h2>

<p>You are to describe:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The context for your Professional Experience.<p>
A description of those aspects of your Professional Experience context that will impact upon and must be considered when you are integrating ICTs into the teaching you will do on Professional Experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>  Your approach to planning ICT integration.<p>A description of the approach you will use to plan the integration of ICTs into your teaching while on Professional Experience. i.e. when you sit down to plan a lesson in which you must integrate ICTs, how are you going to do it? This might include (but not be limited to): </p>
       <ul>
         <li> your views of learning and teaching that inform your approach to planning; 
        </li> <li> your view of the role of ICTs in student learning; and, 
        </li> <li> a discussion of the specific processes, literature, theories, strategies, tools, systems and other insights you have gained through this course and your broader studies that inform your planning.</li>
      </ul>
</ol>
<p>The above can be provided in the form of prose, dot points, tables or diagrams. The aim is to provide a simple and clear explanation of how you will approach the planning of ICT integration into your lessons in ways that are appropriate to your context.</p>

<h3>Word count and other factors</h3>

<p>Some general points about this component</p>
<ul>
  <li> At least 500 words suggested, and not much more than 1000 words <p>If you are taking more than 1000 words you're going into to much detail. If you are write significantly more than 1000 words then the marker will have the option to stop reading and mark based on the first 1000 words or so. </p>
  </li>
  <li> As you are describing what you plan to do, writing the plan in the first person  is acceptable (but not compulsory). </li>
</ul>

<h3>I won't be planning, what do I do?</h3>

<p>You may be in a context where you won't be doing any (or much) planning of lessons. For example, your mentor teacher may have decided that you will follow some established lesson plans verbatim. In this context, you should mention this in your context description, but you should also describe the planning approach you would use for ICT integration if you had the opportunity.</p>

<h3>Rubric - Part B</h3>

<p>Please refer to the rubric below. The following is provided to give some general advice on the marking of this component:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The description of your approach will be worth more than the description of your context. 
  </li> <li> In describing your context only mention those factors appropriate to planning ICT integration.
<p>For example, the names of your school, your mentor, or your students should not be included. The year level (age of your students) is appropriate as it is necessary that your planning results in learning experiences that are age appropriate and aligned with the appropriate curriculum.</p>
  </li> <li> In describing your approach to planning ensure that it is
   <ul>
       <li> appropriate and linked to your context description;
  </li> <li> internally consistent and logical; and,
<p>e.g. you can't say your teaching is based entirely on socio-constructivist learning theories and then talk about using behaviourist approaches to teaching. </p>
  </li> <li> linked to appropriate literature, theory etc. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Part C - Lesson Plans</h2>

<p>As part of your Professional Experience you are expected to be teaching for a minimum of a third to a maximum of two-thirds of each day (with a full day toward the end of week 4). As part of this, it is expected that you will prepare lesson plans that you mentor will review prior to your teaching. </p>
<p>For this component you must submit 5 of the lesson plans that you teach while on Professional Experience. </p>
<p>It is expected that these lesson plans will</p>
<ul><li> Include the integration of ICTs to enhance student learning.
  </li> <li> Initial reflection on the lesson's implementation by you.
  </li> <li> Feedback from your mentor teacher on the lesson's implementation.
  </li> <li> Be otherwise complete and appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are expected to refer to these lesson plans in Part D of this assignment. So, select the 5 lesson plans that best illustrate the points you wish to make in Part D.</p>

<h3>Lesson plan template</h3>

<p>The default preference is that you use <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/171366/mod_folder/content/0/Lesson%20Planning%20Template.docx?forcedownload=1">the EDC3100 lesson plan template</a> provided on the study desk. However, you are able to use a different lesson plan template if it is more appropriate to your context. e.g. required by your mentor.</p>

<h3>Special circumstances</h3>

<p>There are students whose circumstances may hinder their ability to meet the requirements of this section. Please check the following list for existing advice. If you circumstances aren't covered, please contact <a href="http://apps.usq.edu.au/StaffSearch/default.aspx?staffsearchaction=showdetails&staffsearchrecordid=5543">the course examiner</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Have already completed Professional Experience (e.g. an exemption from Professional Experience this semester).<p>You should use lesson plans you taught on your prior Professional Experience. If you don't have access to them anymore, contact the course examiner. For more information on this special circumstance, please read <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=114592#p466070">this forum post</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li> You will be teaching in a BVET area.<p>Consideration is being given to a sector appropriate equivalent and will be communicated soon. You will still have to submit a description of teaching you undertook while on Professional Experience within which ICTs were integrated. The questions to be decided are how much and in what form? </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rubric - Part C</h3>

<p>Refer to the rubric below. The general approach is that if you submit 5 lesson plans that include some evidence of ICT integration into student learning and are of an acceptable standard (e.g. all components are complete, there are no hugely glaring errors etc.) you will receive the complete 5% for this component.</p>

<p>A complete lesson plan will include: some evidence of the use of ICTs to enhance learning, reflection on the lesson, some feedback form the mentor teacher.</p>

<h2>Part D - Evaluation and lessons learned</h2>

<p>You are to evaluate the integration of ICT during your Professional Experience and identify lessons you need to apply for your future teaching. In doing so, you should address the following questions:</p>
<ul>  <li> Evaluation
    <ul> 
        <li> What were the successes you achieved? What made them successful and why?
     </li> <li> What were the not so successful components and why?
     </li> <li> What factors (within the school/classroom) impacted on you ICT integration?
     </ul>
 </li> <li> Lessons learned.
    <ul>
    <li> Based on the above, how will you change your ICT integration planning (that you developed in Part B of this assignment) for your next Professional Experience? Why? </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>Your answers to these questions should be supported with references to the 5 lesson plans submitted with this assignment, your broader Professional Experience, and appropriate literature and theory. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/171366/mod_folder/content/0/Assignment%203/Template%20for%20Part%20D%20Essay.docx?forcedownload=1">sample template</a> for this essay has been provided. More to offer another explanation of the requirements than as a compulsory structure for the essay. i.e. you don't have to use this template for your essay. Further explanation of the template and the requirements for the assignment will be available in the Week 15 learning path.</p>

<h3>Rubric - Part D</h3>

<p>Refer to the rubric below. The following provides some advice on how this component will be marked.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The evaluation section will be worth more than the lessons learned section.
  </li> <li> Both the evaluation and lessons learned sections should
     <ul>
        <li> Draw on theory and literature to explain your position.
       </li> <li> Make explicit reference to both your "Preparation and Planning" response for Part B and the 5 lesson plans you submitted for Part C of this assignment.</li>
      </ul>
