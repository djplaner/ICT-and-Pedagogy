<h2>Assessment and the Australian Curriculum (and other curricula)</h2>

<p>The following list offers general advice about how each of the assignments may be associated with the Australian Curriculum.</p>
<h3>Assignment 1</h3>

       <p>No requirement that the Australian Curriculum must be used, but it can help.</p>
<p> For part 1 (the learning journal) you simply need to complete the study desk activities and your learning journal posts. We won't be checking here if you're using the Australian Curriculum or not. But where appropriate you should use it.</p>
<p>For part 2, it is important that the reasons, evidence and examples you provide are appropriate to the context you describe. The Australian Curriculum (or other appropriate curriculum documents) may provide evidence and examples, but you are not required to use them.</p>

<h3>Assignment 2 (and Module 2)</h3>

      <p>Module 2 and Assignment 2 develop and assess your ability to design a unit of work aligned with a curriculum. The module and assignment will be using the Australian Curriculum as the main context. </p>
      <p>If you have a teaching area that is connected with the Australian Curriculum (<strong>and</strong> the learning area has been endorsed by the ministerial council), you must use it for this module and assignment. (See <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=262&amp;chapterid=1131">this page</a> for more information).</p>
      <p>If your teaching areas don't include the Australian Curriculum (e.g. TAFE/VET sector or overseas students) then you will need to use your appropriate curriculum documents (please contact the course examiner if you are in this situation). </p>


<h3>Assignment 3</h3>

      <p>Focuses on you preparing, teaching and reflecting/evaluating on your Professional Experience. This will include appropriate use of the curriculum documents appropriate to the context.  i.e. you use whatever is in use at your Professional Experience site.</p>


<a name="book"></a>
<h2>Help with using a Moodle "book"</h2>

<p>This is a Moodle "book". It's a resource created by Moodle (the software the USQ study desk uses) and is essentially a collection of pages combined into one resources. A Moodle book provides a number of common features, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A list of all the pages in the book.
<p>In the top left hand corner you should be able to see a list of the pages in this book.  You can click on a page to go there. </p>
  </li>
  <li> Next page and Previous page.
<p>Over to the right of the page, you should be able to see some arrows. You can use these to move to the next or the previous page.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Print the book or its chapters.
    <p>In the left hand column, towards the bottom of the column, you should see a block called "Settings".  Within that block there are two links "Print book" and "Print chapter".  These allow you to print a copy of either the book or a particular chapter within the book. </li>
</ul></div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="2" data-contentformat="1" data-title="How to request an extension" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">How to request an extension</h1><p>As per <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/current-students/assessment/assignments/extensions">USQ advice</a> an extension is applicable when <strong>unforeseen circumstances</strong> prevent you from submitting an assignment on time. The following discusses:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Will you get an extension? </li>
  <li> Professional experience delays and extensions for assignment 3. </li>
  <li> How do you ask for an extension? </li>
</ul>

<h2>Will you get an extension?</h2>

<p>The following are some of the questions I will ask myself before granting any extension. The outcome of a request is largely dependent on the nature of the circumstances for the request, when you ask for the extension, how you ask, and your participation so far in the course.</p>

<p><strong>Are the circumstances truly unforeseen?</strong></p>

<p>USQ policy defines extensions as being for unforeseen circumstances. This means events that you hadn't expected to happen such as illness, flood etc.</p>
<p>Existing work commitments, sports carnivals and family holidays are typically <strong>not</strong> unforeseen events.  If you know something is coming up that will make it difficult to meet an assignment deadline, then it's your responsibility to plan around this and meet the deadline.</p>

<p><strong>Are you applying before the due date?</strong></p>

<p>Typically you should apply for an extension <strong>BEFORE</strong> the due date. An extension requested after the due date is unlikely to be granted. Obviously this depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Asking for an extension on the weekend or the day the assignment is due is also somewhat questionable, unless circumstances have made it difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Have you provided appropriate documentary evidence?</strong></p>

<p>If you haven't provided appropriate supporting evidence, the request may be declined. </p>
<p>The evidence should also match your request. For example, if you ask for a 1 week extension for reason of illness.  Then the medical certificate should indicate you were unfit for duty for 1 week.</p>

<p><strong>Have you been keeping up with the work?</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the nature of the reason for the extension request, I will closely look at your work on the learning journal (i.e. completing learning path activities and posting to your blog).  If this shows you haven't been working consistently then the chances of the extension being granted are small.</p>


<h2>Professional Experience delays and assignment 3</h2>

<p>Assignment 3 is based heavily on your Professional Experience. You need to complete Professional Experience before submitting assignment 3. You need time after Professional Experience to reflect and complete assignment 3.</p>
<p> If your Professional Experience will finish later than the set Professional Experience period, you can ask for an extension for assignment 3 via the normal means below.</p>
<p>How much of an extension? You will normally be expected to submit your Assignment 3 the same number of days after you finish Professional Experience as the students who have to meet the normal due date (e.g. if the default Assignment 3 due date is 5 days after a normal Professional Experience finishes, then you will have to submit your assignment 3 5 days after you finish Professional Experience)</p>

<h2>How do you ask for an extension?</h2>

<p><a href="mailto:david.jones2@usq.edu.au">Send me</a> an email containing the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Your name and student number. </li>
  <li> The assignment you are requesting the extension for. </li>
  <li> How long an extension you would like to have.<p>You may not get what you ask for, but give an indication.</p> </li>
  <li> The reason why you need the extension. </li>
  <li> If appropriate, any supporting evidence.<p>e.g. if you've been sick a Doctor's certificate is usually required.</p> </li>
</ul>
</div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="3" data-contentformat="1" data-title="Learning Journal" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">Learning Journal</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />

<h2>What is a learning journal?</h2>

<p>For EDC3100, your learning journal is a combination of:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The posts you share on your blog. </li>
  <li> Completion of the learning path activities each week. </li>
</ol>

<h2>How will it be marked?</h2>

<p>Your learning journal in combination with your completion of the Study Desk activities, will contribute a total of 15% of your final mark for this course. 5% in each assignment. </p>
<p>Your learning journal will not be analysed by the teaching staff and marked against a rubric. This is so you feel free to reflect as you wish in your journal and are not tempted to write what you think we want to hear.</p>
<p>That said, your blog will by default be open to others. You are encouraged to comment on the work of others and have them comment on your work. This is a part of constructing your PLN.  </p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the public nature of your blog, please contact the course examiner.</p>
<p>Each assignment page uses the same rubric for the learning journal component. The "exceptional standard" (what you need to achieve to get full marks) for the learning journal has specific criterion. These criterion - and some additional explanation - include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 3 or more blog posts each week.
        <p>You should aim to do 3 posts per week, however, the marking system will only count the average posts per week. For example, for <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=338&amp;chapterid=1394">assignment 1</a> you have to write blog posts during Module 1. As per <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/page/view.php?id=337">the study schedule</a> Module 1 covers weeks 1, 2 and 3. Three weeks.  Three weeks multiply three posts per week means you need to write 9 posts during Module 1 to get full marks.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Average length of blog posts at least 100 words.
         <p>The number of words in each of your posts for an assignment are added up and then divided by the number of posts.  That gives the average number of words per post. This average needs to be greater than 100.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 60% or more of the blog posts contain links to online resources.
        <p>This is to encourage you to be looking at and sharing online resources.</p>
        <p>If you've written 9 posts for Assignment 1, then to get full marks 60% of those 9 posts need to contain links to online resources. 60% of 9 = 5.4.  This means at least 6 of your posts need to have links to online resources.</p> </li>
  <li> More than two posts contain links to posts from other EDC3100 students.
       <p>This is to encourage you to read and comment on other students' blogs.</p>
        <p>More than 2 of the blog posts you've written for an assignment need to have links to blog posts of other EDC3100 students.</p> </li>
  <li> All learning path activities completed.
       <p>Assignment 1 covers Module 1 - weeks 1, 2 and 3. This means that to get full marks for assignment 1, you need to have ticks in the boxes next to each activity and resource on the study desk for weeks 1, 2 and 3.</p> </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Ensure the posts are meaningful, reflective and are of a good standard. You don’t have to use formal academic writing, however, you should appreciate that your blog and your journal are a professional document. It should reflect your status as a professional educator. It should demonstrate appropriate ethical (e.g. don’t copy the work of others), spelling and grammatical standards.</p> 

<p>Your final mark will be determined by a combination of</p>
<ol>
  <li> Automated assessment and analysis.<p>
A computer program will be used to ensure that you completed all Study Desk activities, that you have posted regularly during the semester, and that the posts are of a reasonable quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Random sampling.
      <p>Teaching staff will manually check a random sample of learning journals.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As the semester progresses we a report will be emailed to each student indicating their progress toward the learning journal component of the assignment. That report will look something like the following sample.</p>
<a name="report"></a>
<blockquote>
<h3>Sample report</h3>

<p>Number: u000000 (00000000000)<br />
Name: Student, Some<br />
Result: 5 out of 5<br /></p>
<p>You received: 5 out of 5 for the learning journal component of assignment 2.</p>
<p>This mark is the average of the following five individual marks. Each of these marks relates to the rubric on the assignment 2 page on the Study Desk.</p>
<ul>
  <li> You completed 100% of the learning path activities for the first 3 weeks. More than 90% of activities complete means 5 marks. </li>
  <li> Your average post length was 435.4 words. Calculated by the total word count of all your posts divided by the number of posts. An average length greater than 100 words gives 5 marks.</li>
  <li> 90.9% of your posts contained links. More than 60% of posts with links means 5 marks.</li>
  <li> You had 4 posts with links to other student blogs. More than 2 posts with link(s) to other student blogs means 5 marks. </li>
  <li> You had an average of 3.7 posts per week. Calculated by your total number of posts divided by 3 weeks. More than 2 posts means 5 marks </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>The main reasons for asking you to keep a learning journal include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> To encourage you to reflect on your learning.<p>You can't learn effectively without engaging in reflection. </p>
  </li>
  <li> To make your learning visible and thus encourage discussion and collaboration.</li>
  <li> To provide a reason to engage in writing a blog and building your PLN.</li>
  <li> Provide you with artifacts you can use for other assignments.<p>
Some of what you post on your blog will be re-used for other assignments. </p>
  </li>
  <li> To encourage you to engage in the active use of ICTs for your own learning.<p>
All of these contribute to the overall reason for asking you to maintain a learning journal. i.e. to improve your learning.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What do I need to do?</h2>

<p>In short, you need to engage in a cycle of Personal Knowledge Management as explained during the <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/page/view.php?id=131407">Week 1 activities</a>. As a part of this you should also be (don’t limit yourself to just these)</p>
<ol>
  <li> Adding posts in response to tasks on the Study Task. </li>
  <li>	Engaging in reflection about your learning.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>Every time you engage with an EDC3100 learning task, give some thought to what has happened and how you are feeling about it. If there’s something you need to reflect more deeply upon, develop your thinking while writing, or share with others then write a blog post about it.</p>
<p>You don’t need to write a journal entry for everything you do for the course, but when something strikes you as important, puzzling, difficult, misleading, strange, fun, exciting, amazing or simply interesting then you should explore and write about that feeling. Why? How does it connect to what you know? How does it transform what you believe?</p>
<p>At times the course material will post questions about what you’ve just done or read. These are intended to encourage you to reflect and consider your perspective. These would be good opportunities to write a post (or at least part of one).</p>
<p>It is expected that you should have at least two blog posts per week.</p>
<p>Some questions that might help you get started with reflection, include (but certainly aren't limited to):</p>
<ol>
  <li> What do you think (and feel) about the concepts and ideas you’ve engaged with? Why?</li>
  <li> Did anything inspire you? </li>
  <li> What puzzled you? What seemed difficult or contradictory?</li>
  <li> What do you need to know more about and how can you get that knowledge?</li>
  <li> Have any of your opinions or values changed? </li>
  <li>	What can you do better next time? To learn better? </li>
  <li> How can I use what I've learned in my  teaching? </li>
  <li> What do I need to know to use that in my teaching? </li>
</ol>

<p><A href="http://www.peterpappas.com/2010/01/taxonomy-reflection-critical-thinking-students-teachers-principals-.html">This post</a> provides a taxonomy of reflection tied to Bloom's taxonomy that could prove useful.</p>
</div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="4" data-contentformat="1" data-title="Problems with the learning journal" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">Problems with the learning journal</h1><p>The following is a collection of known problems with the learning journal. It is divided up into problems with learning path completion and problems with your blog.  The list of known problems currently includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Learning path completion (ticks in the boxes)
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="#wonttick">The box won't tick for an activity</a> </li>
            <li> <a href="#stillwonttick">The box still won't tick for an activity and I can't do it manually.</a> </li>
            <li> <a href="#nobox">There's no box for the activity</a> </li>
        </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Blog posts
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="#notlink">It's counting the wrong number of links</a> </li>

        </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These may not be the only source of problems. If none of these work, contact the course examiner for some clarification.</p>

<h2>Learning path completion</h2>

<a name="wonttick"></a>
<h3>The box won't tick for an activity</h3>

<p>There is a box next to an activity, but no matter what you do a tick won't appear.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Does the box have a dashed line around it? Or is the line solid?</p>
<p>If the line is solid, you will need to manually click on the box for the tick to appear.</p>
<p>This is a mistake in how the activity was created. Rather than automatically giving you a tick as you complete the activity, it's been set up with manual completion.</p>

<a name="stillwonttick"></a>
<h3>The box still won't tick for an activity and I can't do it manually.</h3>

<p>Are you really sure that you completed all of the tasks required to get a tick for the activity?</p>
<p>For example, some forums may require that you contribute more than one post before you get a tick. For example, the introduction forum requires three posts: your introduction, say hi to someone similar, and say hi to someone different.</p>
<p>Other activities will require you to perform a particular task. For example, share a personal story about Postman's 5 things to know about technological change. If you posted to the forum, but your post did not fulfil the requirements of the task, then the teaching staff may have deleted your post.  You need to complete the activity's full requirements.</p>

<a name="nobox"></a>
<h3>There's no tick box for an activity</h3>

<p>Not all activities or resources in the learning path are compulsory. There are some you don't need to do. If there is no tick box next to an activity or resource it is optional and is not counted in calculations of marks for the learning path.</p>

<h2>Your blog</h2>

<a name="notlink"></a>
<h3>It's counting the wrong number of links etc.</h3>

<p>Are you sure that you've posted many more posts containing links than are showing up in the report?</p>
<p>Double check your posts, can you actually click on the links and get taken to a different web page?</p>
<p>Do your "links" look like </p>
<ol>
  <li> http://www.usq.edu.au 
          <p>This is not a link. It's just some text that is a URL.  But you can't click on it, so it's not a link. It won't be counted by the system.</p> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au">http://www.usq.edu.au</a>
          <p>This is a link. You can click on it and get taken to the new web page. This will be counted.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<a name="feedly"></a>
<h3>It's counting the wrong number of links to student posts</h3>

<p>Are you sure that you have more posts that are linking to posts from other students?</p>
<p>Have you checked whether the links to student posts actually link to their blog post? Or does the link point to Feedly?</p>
<p>Some students have been copying the link to see the post on Feedly, not the link to see the post on the student's blog.</p>
<p>The system only knows about the student's blog.</p>

<p>A similar proble arises with a <strong>Wordpress reader link</strong>. For example, one student used <a href="http://wordpress.com/#/read/post/id/64752414/77/">this as a link</a> (http://wordpress.com/#/read/post/id/64752414/77/) to a student's post.    It's actually a link into the Wordpress.com blog reader.  It's not a link to the original student's post.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://andrewjchristian310.wordpress.com/2014/03/09/diigo-i-love-it/">student's original post</a> is here - http://andrewjchristian310.wordpress.com/2014/03/09/diigo-i-love-it/.</p>

<a name="changing"></a>
<h3>Have you been changing posts after publishing them?</h3>

<p>Have you been creating posts, publishing them and then coming back later to edit and change published posts?</p>
<p>If so, this is likely to cause problems. The automated system regularly mirrors (makes a copy of) posts on your blog.  Once it's copied a post, it doesn't update that post. </p>
<p>Any changes you make to a post after it's been copied, won't be known about by the system.</p>

<p><strong>solution</strong></p>
<p>Don't publish a blog post until it's complete.  If you have to update something, write a new post.</p>

<a name="pages"></a>
<h3>It's counting the wrong number of posts (you've been creating pages, not posts)</h3>

<p>Are you sure that you've created more posts on your blog than the automated system is counting?</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> you need to be aware of the differences between posts and pages. These are two different methods by which you can add content to your blog. Wordpress maintains <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/post-vs-page/">this page</a> that explains the difference from a Wordpress perspective. In terms of this course, the difference is <blockquote> Posts == good.  Pages == bad</blockquote></p>
<p>
The automated system used to make the learning journal can only see posts.  It won't see pages and thus cannot include them in your mark.  Any pages you add to your blog, won't be counted for assessment. </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>If you have already created a collection of pages, you need to create pages with that same content (if you want them to count to your mark).  To do this, you will have to for each page you have created</p>
<ol>
  <li> Edit the page and copy the content.</li>
  <li> Create a new post with the same title.</li>
  <li> Paste the content from the page into the new post.</li>
  <li> Publish the new post </li>
</ol>

<a name="short"></a>
<h3>The automated system thinks my posts are really short</h3>

<p>Is the average work count for your posts too small? </p>
<p>The automated system calculates the average word count of all your posts. You're aiming for at least 100 words per post.  In some cases the system may report that your posts are all much less than 100 words and you know that your posts are much longer.</p>
<p>This is probably a result of having your blog's feed set to "summary", rather than "full".</p>
<p>So, what is a feed? It's a software readable version of your blog posts. Your feed is used by software such as Feedly or the automated system marking the learning journal to obtain copies of your blog posts.  Every time you create a new post, it appears both on your blog (e.g. my blog at <a href="http://davidtjones.wordpress.com/">http://davidtjones.wordpress.com</a>) and in your feed (e.g. mine at <a href="http://davidtjones.wordpress.com/feed/">http://davidtjones.wordpress.com/feed/</a>).</p>
<p>Wordpress.com allows you to configure your feed. One option is whether your feed is set to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Full - so the full contents of your posts go into your feed. </li>
  <li> Summary - so only the first couple of lines of your post goes into your feed. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the automated system is only seeing the first couple of lines of your posts, it's probably because your feed is set to "summary".</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Go to the dashboard of your blog, go to "Reading Settings" and look for the option "For each article in a feed, show" and set the option to "Full Text", not summary. <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/settings/reading-settings/">This page</a> from Wordpress.com offers some additional explanation.</p></div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="5" data-contentformat="1" data-title="Assignment 1" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">Assignment 1</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />

<h2>ICTs: Why and what?</h2>

<p>Later in the semester you will be going on Professional Experience. On Professional Experience - as stated in the Professional Experience handbook â€“ your required tasks will include:<blockquote>Teaching and planning: Lesson sequences and small units of work where ICT is integral to the learning and teaching process</blockquote></p>
<p>In preparing to do this, you will need to think about how you will use ICTs and why you will use them. Obviously (or at least it should be obvious as you progress in this course) you will be using ICTs to enhance your students' learning and your teaching. But what are some specific examples of how you will use ICTs to achieve this in your particular context?</p>
<p>Your task is to create a <em>web-based artefact</em> that will persuasively inform the parents/carers of your students (or your students if you're in adult education) of why and how you will be using ICTS to improve their learning. Your task is to convince them that (explain why) using ICTs to improve your students' learning is a good idea.</p>
<p>The term "web-based artefact" is used so as not to constrain your creativity. The only requirements are that it the artefact must be able to be viewed via a Web browser, be presented or linked to from your blog, and <strong>NOT</strong> be an essay put in a web page! </p>

<h3>Example artefacts</h3>

<p>Three examples from prior offerings of the course are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://ictsandtheclassroomrevolution.weebly.com/">ICTs and the Classroom Revolution</a> - a website. </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.glogster.com/frintzilas/enable-evolutionary-essential-/g-6kssa1cbmvcouq1tvui9pa0">Enable, evolutionary, essential</a> - a Glogster. </li>
  <li> <a href="http://prezi.com/rky2gzhh6njz/why-use-icts-in-special-education/">Why use ICTs in Special Education?</a> - a Prezi. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note:</em> in prior offerings of the course, the web-based artefact was aimed at persuading another teacher. This year you have to persuade parents. People who usually know nothing about educational jargon.</p>
<p>More examples and ideas for your web-based artefact will be covered in the learning paths.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>This assignment is intended to encourage you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Synthesise and personalise the reasons for integrating ICTs into your teaching and lay a foundation for your work later in the semester.
     <p>i.e. you will have to actively search out reasons for using ICTs to enhance learning that are appropriate to your teaching context. </p></li>
  <li> Encourage you to explore the use of an online medium for presenting information.
     <p>Being able to "create and use a range of resources, including ICT" is part of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers #3.4 for Proficient teachers.</p>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>More formally, the assignment is intended to provide you an opportunity to meet the following course objectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li> outline the influence on curriculum and pedagogy of historical and current international and national policies and initiatives relevant to the use of ICT in diverse learning and teaching contexts;</li>
  <li> examine, discuss and reflect on core ideas about the knowledge generation and knowledge economy and the implications of these for curriculum and pedagogy;</li>
  <li> discuss and reflect upon the role of ICT in the curriculum, learning and teaching;</li>
  <li> examine and critique personal beliefs and practices that impact on their use of ICT for learning and teaching;</li>
  <li> demonstrate competence in and appropriate use of language and literacy, including spelling, grammar, punctuation and bibliographic referencing. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>Your online artefact should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clearly describe your teaching context.
<p>If you don't know exactly where your Professional Experience will be take an educated guess or pick a previous site where you have completed Professional Experience. Whatever you choose, it should be as close to type of site you will attend for your EDC3100 Professional Experience. Your description of the context should provide sufficient information to support your reasons for using ICTs. It might include: the relevant curriculum, available resources, the nature of the students, the site's pedagogical framework or approach, or any other relevant information.</p>
  <p>The context does not necessarily need to be a class setting. It might be a sub-set of the class. For example, a particular group of learners (e.g. indigenous learners) within that class, or a particular subject area (or two).</p>
  </li>
  <li> Provide reasons for using ICTs to enhance students' learning within that context.
<p>The reasons should not be generic (e.g. "students with ICT-skills are more employable"). The reasons should be explained directly to your description of the teaching context (e.g. "our students have difficulty appreciating some abstract mathematical principles due to the limited physical conceptions). The reasons should be supported by or draw upon established research, policy or other appropriate external foundations. However, you need to explain this in layman's terms (i.e. without the educational jargon).</p>
  </li>
  <li> Use contextually appropriate example(s) to illustrate those reasons.
<p>Each reason should also be illustrated with an example of how another educator has already used ICTs to achieve the stated benefit. The example(s) should be drawn from a context very similar to your teaching context. That is, if you're teaching into Year 3, then the example should be for a Year 3 class, or very close (e.g. year 2 or 4). </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The artefact should be no more than the equivalent of 1000 words or 7 minutes speaking time. It should be designed to generate a positive reaction from a viewer/reader.</p>

<ol>
  <li> Completion of the learning path activities for Module 2. </li>
  <li> Posts on your blog that reflect reflect on your deeper understandings of ICTs in the classroom as you build your unit. <p>During Module 2, write posts regularly each week that reflect on that week's EDC3100 learning path. If you work through the break, continue to add to your blog about your learning and the processes you are using to develop your assignments or other activities of importance to your classroom practice and using ICTs.</p></li>

<h2>Assignment 3 - Overview</h2>

<p>Assignment 3 is designed to help you prepare, implement and reflect on your use of ICTs in learning and teaching in a real context. It is designed to build on work you've already done in Assignments 1 and 2. The assignment is directly related to your Professional Experience and in particular the following from the Professional Experience Book (p. 19), in that it (emphasis added)<blockquote>provides preservice educators with the opportunity to demonstrate understanding related to ICT and pedagogy and their ability to integrate the curriculum, teaching and learning with ICT. This Professional Experience component will provide specific opportunities for preservice educators to <strong>plan</strong>, <strong>implement</strong> and <strong>reflect</strong> upon their developing ICT pedagogy.</blockquote></p>
<p>NOTE: The aim of this assignment (and course) is for you to design learning experiences that use ICTs to enhance student learning. It is <strong>not</strong> about teaching students to use ICTs.</p>
<p>The following table provides an overview of the components of this assignment.</p>

<h2>Part A: Learning Journal</h2>
<a name="parta"></a>

<p>The learning journal component is similar to the learning journal from assignments 1 and 2. It consists of two parts:</p>
<ol> <li> Completion of the learning path activities for Module 3. </li>
 </li> <li> During Module 3 (but also on Module 4 - Professional Experience) write posts on your blog each week that reflect on that week's EDC3100 learning path. </li>
</ol>
<p>You do not need to complete either the learning path activities or blog posts while you are Professional Experience. However, using your blog to reflect appropriately and get support from your readers may be helpful. </p>

<h3>Rubric - Part A</h3>

<p>This component will mostly be marked automatically using various ICTs. Random checks of a sample of student learning journals will supplement the automated marking.</p>

<a name="partb"></a>
<h2>Part B - Preparation and Planning</h2>

<p>You are to describe:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The context for your Professional Experience.<p>
A description of those aspects of your Professional Experience context that will impact upon and must be considered when you are integrating ICTs into the teaching you will do on Professional Experience.</p>
   <p>Check the rubric below for the type and amount of information you should include. You should aim to gather this information as soon as possible. </p>
  </li>
  <li>  Your approach to planning ICT integration.<p>A description of the approach you will use to design your use of ICTs to enhance student learning while on Professional Experience. i.e. when you sit down to plan a lesson in which you must integrate ICTs, how are you going to do it? This might include (but not be limited to): </p>
       <ul>
         <li> your views of learning and teaching that inform your approach to planning; 
        </li> <li> your view of the role of ICTs in student learning; and, 
        </li> <li> a discussion of the <strong>specific</strong> processes, literature, theories, strategies, tools, systems and other insights you have gained through this course and your broader studies that inform your planning.</li>
      </ul>
</ol>
<p>The above can be provided in the form of prose, dot points, tables or diagrams. The aim is to provide a simple and clear explanation of how you will approach the planning of ICT integration into your lessons in ways that are appropriate to your context.</p>
<p>You should aim to have this completed - at least in a 1st draft form - prior to going on Professional Experience. You should actually use this process whilst on Professional Experience. But feel free to modify the process if you (will) get new insights about the context and your learners. </p>

<h3>Word count and other factors</h3>

<p>Some general points about this component</p>
<ul>
  <li> At least 500 words suggested, and not much more than 1000 words <p>If you are taking more than 1000 words you're going into to much detail. If you are write significantly more than 1000 words then the marker will have the option to stop reading and mark based on the first 1000 words or so. </p>
  </li>
  <li> As you are describing what you plan to do, writing the plan in the first person is acceptable (but not compulsory). </li>
</ul>

<h3>I won't be planning, what do I do?</h3>

<p>You may be in a context where you won't be doing any (or much) planning of lessons. For example, your mentor teacher may have decided that you will follow some established lesson plans verbatim. In this context, you should mention this in your context description, but you should also describe the planning approach you would use for ICT integration if you had the opportunity.</p>
<p>You should also - if at all possible - talk further with your mentor and explain the purpose of this course is for you to actually design and deliver your own lessons. </p>

<h3>Rubric - Part B</h3>

<p>Please refer to the rubric below. The following is provided to give some general advice on the marking of this component:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The description of your approach will be worth more than the description of your context. 
  </li> <li> In describing your context only mention those factors appropriate to planning ICT integration.
<p>For example, the names of your school, your mentor, or your students should not be included. The year level (age of your students) is appropriate as it is necessary that your planning results in learning experiences that are age appropriate and aligned with the appropriate curriculum.</p>
  </li> <li> In describing your approach to planning ensure that it is
   <ul>

<h2>Part C - Lesson Plans</h2>

<p>As part of your Professional Experience you are expected to be teaching for a minimum of a third to a maximum of two-thirds of each day (with a full day toward the end of week 4). As part of this, it is expected that you will prepare lesson plans that you mentor will review prior to your teaching. </p>
<p>For this component you must submit 5 of the lesson plans that you teach while on Professional Experience. </p>
<p>It is expected that these lesson plans will</p>
<ul><li> Include the integration of ICTs to enhance student learning.
  </li> <li> Initial reflection on the lesson's implementation by you.
  </li> <li> Feedback from your mentor teacher on the lesson's implementation.
  </li> <li> Be otherwise complete and appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are expected to refer to these lesson plans in Part D of this assignment. So, select the 5 lesson plans that best illustrate the points you wish to make in Part D.</p>

<h3>Lesson plan template</h3>

<p>The default preference is that you use <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/202988/mod_folder/content/0/Lesson%20Planning%20Template.docx?forcedownload=1">the EDC3100 lesson plan template</a> provided on the study desk. However, you are able to use a different lesson plan template if it is more appropriate to your context. e.g. required by your mentor.</p>

<h3>Special circumstances</h3>

<p>There are students whose circumstances may hinder their ability to meet the requirements of this section. Please check the following list for existing advice. If you circumstances aren't covered, please contact <a href="http://apps.usq.edu.au/StaffSearch/default.aspx?staffsearchaction=showdetails&staffsearchrecordid=5543">the course examiner</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Have already completed Professional Experience (e.g. an exemption from Professional Experience this semester).<p>You should use lesson plans you taught on your prior Professional Experience. If you don't have access to them anymore, contact the course examiner. For more information on this special circumstance, please read <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=114592#p466070">this forum post</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li> You will be teaching in a BVET area.<p>Please read the <a href="#bvet">VET considerations</a> for Part C below. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rubric - Part C</h3>

<p>Refer to the rubric below. The general approach is that if you submit 5 lesson plans that include some evidence of ICT integration into student learning and are of an acceptable standard (e.g. all components are complete, there are no hugely glaring errors etc.) you will receive the complete 5% for this component.</p>

<p>A complete lesson plan will include: some evidence of the use of ICTs to enhance learning, reflection on the lesson, some feedback form the mentor teacher.</p>

<h2>Part D - Evaluation and lessons learned</h2>

<p>You are to evaluate the integration of ICT during your Professional Experience and identify lessons you need to apply for your future teaching. In doing so, you should address the following questions:</p>
<ul>  <li> Evaluation
    <ul> 
        <li> What were the successes you achieved? What made them successful and why?
     </li> <li> What were the not so successful components and why?  
           <p><em>Note:</em> Your failure to plan appropriately or prepare a backup plan for technology failure, can only form one of these not so successful stories. The focus should be on student learning. When did students not learn as effectively as you hoped? Why? </p>
     </li> 
     <li> What factors (within the school/classroom) impacted on you ICT integration?
        <p>See above note about failure to plan.</p>
         </li>
     </ul>
 </li> <li> What you've learned.
    <ul>
    <li> Based on the above, how will you change your ICT integration planning (that you developed in Part B of this assignment) for your next Professional Experience? Why? </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>Your answers to these questions should be supported with references to the 5 lesson plans submitted with this assignment, your broader Professional Experience, and appropriate literature and theory. </p>

<h3>Important - focus on student learning</h3>

<p>It is not uncommon for an EDC3100 pre-service teacher whilst on Professional Experience to have either a planning failure or a technology failure. </p>
<p>A planning failure typically arises when the pre-service teacher has used a particular ICT (e.g. Padlet) personally and all has worked well. However, the pre-service teacher has then forgotten that using Padlet with a class for 25 Year 3 students in a school-based computer lab with a limited network connection is a very different story. The pre-service teacher discovers problems such as (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li> Padlet is blocked by the school's Internet filter. </li>
  <li> Students need to create an account before they can use the tool, and creating these accounts takes the entire lesson. </li>
  <li> Padlet won't run on the computers in the computer lab. </li>
</ul>
<p>A technology failure is where some aspect of the necessary infrastructure or technology is broken. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> There's a power blackout. </li>
  <li> An excavator has just cut the school's Internet connection. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are <strong>NOT</strong> interested in hearing these stories in your reflection essay.</p>
<p>We <strong>are</strong> interested in hearing about what planned ICT activities successfully, or not so successfully, enhanced student learning.  We <strong>are</strong> interested in you showing that you are focusing on the quality of student learning. We <strong>are</strong> interested in you being able to explain how you knew student learning was enhanced (or note). We <strong>are</strong> interested in you being able to use literature, theory and research to explore some of the reasons where it was successful (or not so successful). We <strong>are</strong> interested in you being able to explain how you'll change your future practice based on this experience.</p>

<h3>Use the template</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/pluginfile.php/274400/mod_folder/content/0/Assignment3/Template%20for%20Part%20D%20Essay.docx?forcedownload=1">essay template</a> has been provided to help you structure your essay. </p>

<h3>Rubric - Part D</h3>

<p>Refer to the rubric below. The following provides some advice on how this component will be marked.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The evaluation section will be worth more than the lessons learned section.
  </li> <li> Both the evaluation and lessons learned sections should
     <ul>
        <li> Draw on theory and literature to explain your position.
       </li> <li> Make explicit reference to both your "Preparation and Planning" response for Part B and the 5 lesson plans you submitted for Part C of this assignment.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>

<h3>VET considerations for Part C</h3>

<p>The following detail is for VET students taking EDC3100. If you have any questions about any of this, please contact the course examiner.</p>

<p>For Part C above "lesson plans" for VET students be interpreted as 
<blockquote>A description of a teaching experience/episode of at least 60 minutes.</blockquote>

<p>As outlined above, you will need to submit 5 of these that describe an experience/episode you have implemented.  This may require you to describe particular portions of what you're teaching.</p>
<p> The actual format of this description does not need to use the complete school-focused lesson plan, but should aim to at least include the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li> An overview of the aim of the experience/episode. </li>
  <li> Resources needed by you and the students. </li>
  <li> A description of the steps involved in learning and teaching. </li>
  <li> Some reflection on the experience from you </li>
  <li> Some comments from your mentor, if possible. </li>
</ul>

<p>The rationale behind this includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It's not uncommon for high schools to have lessons of 70 minutes and longer, hence these maintains some level of equity. </li>
  <li> The main requirement for Part C is to have some evidence of you teaching using ICTs that you can use to illustrate your planning (Part B) and mention in your evaluation (Part D). </li>
  <li> A need to match the nature of your context and the requirements for the assignment. </li>
</ul></div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="1" data-pagenum="10" data-contentformat="0" data-title="But I'm not going on Professional Experience?" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">But I'm not going on Professional Experience?</h1><h3>The problem</h3>

<p>Parts B, C and D of Assignment 3 are directly connect to Professional Experience. But you aren't going on Professional Experience this semester. What do you do for Part B, C, and D?</p>

<p>This problem is generally faced by people who have previously passed the EDC3100 Professional Experience, but failed the theory component.</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>

<p>You much still complete the assignment, however, you will either draw on: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Your previous EDC3100 Professional Experience, or 
         <p>This is usually the most common approach, more detail on it below.</p>
  <li> on a new Professional Experience.
        <p>You may be going on Professional Experience for another course this semester. If this is the case, you can use that PE as the basis for your assignment. This is a good solution if it is available to you.</p><p>If you take this approach, you can follow the advice given in the learning paths, just apply it to your new PE.</p>
   </li>
</ol>

<h3>How to use a past PE</h3>

<p>To use your previous Professional Experience for Assignment 3 you should:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Ensure that your cover sheet indicates that you were exempt from PE this semester and that you are using a past PE. </li>
  <li> Part A - write a new version of Part A drawing on your original knowledge of your old PE context, but modify the description of your planning approach based on what you've learned this semester. </li>
  <li> Part B - submit copies of lesson plans from your previous PE. Don't create new lesson plans.</li>
  <li> Part C - write a new Part C using your lesson plans and experience from your old PE, but informed by the new knowledge you've gained from the course. </li>
</ol>

If yes, here's the process you use to query the marking.</p>

<ol>
  <li> <p>Write an email <a href="mailto:david.jones@usq.edu.au">to the course examiner</a> outlining your questions or concerns.</p>
          <p><strong>Don't</strong> contact any other member of the teaching staff, they can't help you. Final word on marking falls to the course examiner.</p>
          <p>If you believe there has been a mistake, then <strong>do</strong> clearly explain the mistake, including explaining why you think it's a mistake.</p>
         <p><strong>Don't</strong> just write "I deserve a better mark" explain why you deserve a better mark with explicit reference to the rubric, assignment sheet or other advice you were given on the assignment. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <p>Wait for my initial reply via email.</p>
           <p>I will wait a few days after the return of assignments to provide time for all marking queries to arrive.  This allows me identify any patterns that may be present.</p>
            <p>I will then reply via email responding to your query with specific details and a description of the outcome.</p>
       </li>
  <li> <p>If your query isn't answered, organise to talk to my via the phone or face-to-face.</p>
         <p>If you aren't satisfied with the answer I provided, please email me with a phone number and times/dates that suit you.  I will give you a call and we can discuss further. Similarly, if appropriate, we can organise a face-to-face conversation.</p> </li>
